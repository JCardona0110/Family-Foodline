## Family Foodline: In progress

I think about all the delicious food my grandmother made for me when she was still alive and how much emotion it brings up in me when those memories arise. I feel extreme sadness that I never took the time to learn and document her recipes and feel that those are also lost now. So in building Family Foodlines I want a place for people to archive their family's recipes and to be able to pass down to later generations and feel the bond that is made through food.
